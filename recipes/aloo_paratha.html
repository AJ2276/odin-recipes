    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Aloo Paratha are popular Indian flatbreads stuffed with a delicious spiced potato
        mixture. In Hindi, Aloo means "Potatoes" and Paratha means "Layered Flatbreads". So
        Aloo Parathas literally mean parathas that are stuffed with boiled, mashed and spiced
        potatoes in between the layers.</p>

    <p>Firstly a dough is made with whole wheat flour. Next boiled potatoes are mashed or
        grated and then spiced. This flavorful spiced potato mixture is then stuffed in a small
        disc of dough and sealed. It is then rolled and pan fried with a generous amount of
        ghee or oil.</p>

    <p>These are made the same way all over India with slight variations in the spices. My
        recipe to make Aloo Paratha has a unique combination of spices so they are flavorful,
        delicious and great tasting.</p>
