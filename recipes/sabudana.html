    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sabudana khichdi is a popular Hindu fasting food where soaked tapioca pearls are
        tempered with curry leaves, whole spices, potatoes and roasted peanuts. It is a popular
        dish from the North Indian and western Indian states.</p>

    <p>Sabudana khichdi is most commonly eaten during Navratri, Ekadashi and other Hindu
        fasting days. But you can also eat it anytime for a breakfast or light dinner.
        Due to the high starch content in sabudana, proper preparation and cooking
        techniques are required. Without that the starches can clump up together to gluey,
        sticky and chewy texture.</p>

    <p>My recipe will help you make the best sabudana khichdi that's non-sticky, fluffy and
        soft with no chewiness in the pearls.
